An attempt to implement a neural network learning program for image-processing,  based off of [this paper by Chao Dong *et al.*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092).

The current program allows to either train for a fixed number of generations or run an already-learned network from a file.

Usage:
```
TRAIN <sampleImageDirectory> <outputDirectory> <generations>
RUN <networkFile> <imageFile> <outputFile>
```

This is no longer in active development, so it is unlikely to get any better than it already is in the foreseeable future.
